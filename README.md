# Aerorequestor

I would like to create a chrome extension that will facilitate certain searches for information on aeronautics.
This is the first time I have created a chrome extension.

Next step :

- [x] Display the METAR according to an airport
- [ ] Select airport on a list
- [ ] Display the windiest airport
- [ ] Select if you want vfr or ifr charts
- [ ] If is Ifr, select the type or charts (ADC,AIC etc...)
- [ ] Display the good charts
- [ ] Have the recommended runway
